# FreeCodeCampbyThao
My solution to FreeCodeCamp's bonfire challenges. 

I am a law student trying to make it in the programming world, one challenge at a time.
I know the chances are low that anyone will come across my repository, but hey, if you do, nice meeting you too.
Comments, suggestions, criticism are more than welcome. And if you found my solutions helpful, I am glad I am of any help, let's get better at this together.

I will try to write an explanation for every challenge, but I don't know if I am well-versed enough to do that. We will see.
And, have a nice day.
